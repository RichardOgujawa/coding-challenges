Link to challenge [HackerRank Arithmetic Operator Challenge](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/python-arithmetic-operators/problem?isFullScreen=true)
The provided code stub reads two integers from STDIN, a and b. Add code to print three lines where:

1. The first line contains the sum of the two numbers.
2. The second line contains the difference of the two numbers (first - second).
3. The third line contains the product of the two numbers.

## **<u>Input Format</u>**

The first line contains the first integer, a.
The second line contains the second integer, b.

## **<u>Constraints</u>**

1 <= a <= (10)^10

1 <= b <= (10)^10

## **<u>Tests</u>**

### **<mark>Test 1</mark>**

_Input_: a = 3, b = 5
